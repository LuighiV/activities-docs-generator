This project arises from the need to generate a summary of activities
registered in a Google SpreadSheets, and which in turn can be used to generate
a Google Docs sheet with the grouped items of according to certain criteria in
the spreadsheet.

## Motivation

This need was presented to my mother who is a teacher and director in charge of
her institution and required to generate a report with the information of the
activities provided by her colleagues. This process used to be done manually
which took a long time. So, I saw that it could be done taking advantage of the
collaborative work offered by Google GSuite and then, by means of this
extension automate the process.

The interface of the extension is designed for this specific scenario.
However, since the source code is open, it can be used to generate other
extensions for generic use cases.

## Features

The extension performs two main tasks:

1. **Generate the summary of activities.** Through this function a general
	 report sheet that groups the activities of all the classrooms of the
	 institution.

2. **Generate the Google Docs document.** From the summary sheet, generates a
	 list of activities grouped according to age criteria and date.
