This extension for Google WorkSpace does not store any user data. All
the data is of exclusive property of the user who creates the 
Google SpreadSheet, based on which the Google Docs document is generated.

All the permissions required by this extension are exclusively to perform
the functions that have been detailed (generate the summary of the activities,
generate the docs document and store them in your Google Drive account). In
no time is the data taken from the Google SpreadSheet or Google document
Docs. Therefore, data security is provided by the servers of
Google.

The extension only makes an anonymous count of users who use the
extension.

For any questions, please, do not hesitate to consult the email of the
developer: <lv@luighiviton.com>.
